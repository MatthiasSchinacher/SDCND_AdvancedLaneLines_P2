# Introduction
This project is my (Matthias Schinacher) homework assignment for Udacity's Self Driving Car Nano Degree
project Advanced Lane Finding.  

# Project Details
The project aims to implement a programming pipeline in python
for identifying a street/ highway lane within a video feed from a camera
typically mounted in the middle of the car dashboard.

# Deliverables
The submission consists mainly of project report (see "report.pdf"),
the python code fragments (see the ".py"- files) and the output
video (see "project_video.mp4" in the folder "output_videos").
The parameters for the solution are those from "params_05.ini".

If you want to run the script, try the command line:
    
    python single_image_pipeline.py params_05.ini

Note: you must have the environment set up as required by
Udacity's Self Driving Car Nano Degree.

You can also process a video, example (30 second clip):

    python clip_pipeline.py some-file.mp4 params_05.ini 30
